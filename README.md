I have built a FakeStore E-Commerce App using React, React Router, and FakeStoreAPI. My app will allow users to view, create, update, and delete products dynamically using API calls. 

It includes:
- Home page with navigation to key sections of the site.
- Product Listing page displaying all available products.
- Product Details page for each product, showing detailed information.
- Add Product page to create new products with form validation.
- Edit Product page to update details of an existing product.
- Delete Product functionality from the product details page with a confirmation modal.

I made sure my App has:
- Fully responsive design, using React Bootstrap for styling.
- Clean, modern layout with card-based product display.
- Mobile-friendly navigation with a collapsible navbar.

And:
- Manages state using useState.
- Fetches, creates, updates, and deletes products using Axios for API.
- Handles loading states, errors, and API responses effectively.
